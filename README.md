# AutoIt Parser

The project was originally started to allow deobfuscation of complicated AutoIt malwares and to play
with computer language parsing and interpreter development. The final goal is to allow malware researchers to 
analyze AutoIt better by allowing:

- Complete parsing of the programming language - This is useful for deobfuscation.
- Emulation - This is useful for dynamic analysis - Allowing AutoIt functions hooks and tracing.

This project is not finished yet, currently allows:

- Parsing simple AutoIt constructs (If statements, functions, while loops, ..)
- Parsing AutoIt expressions 

I implemented all the parsing code to to learn how compiler frotends and interpreters work by developing one.
